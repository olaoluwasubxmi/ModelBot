"Poetry, Grace and Rebellion
Androgynous girls, tomboys with fiery temperaments and bags of personality.
When Louise Despointes founded CITY MODELS in 1978, the oldest model agency in France, followed later on by Frédérika Lévy and Lionel Dejean at the head of the agency, she started recruiting amongst her friends and on the streets. She was looking for ""real faces"": androgynous girls, tomboys with fiery temperament and bags of personality. Feminine James Dean, tattooed aliens, a pure Crow indian… Skinned cats of which CITY exalts the poetic singularity, attracting photographers like Paolo Roversi or Peter Lindbergh, magazines like Vogue or Elle.
""An unparalleled ability to see beauty where others couldn't, until they could""
These are the genes of CITY: a radical approach, an unconventional aesthetics, select what others would call ""anti-models"" and rebels, and turn them into inspirational and iconic characters.
Subversive by nature, CITY ushered in a standard of beauty and remained loyal to it.
In contrast to the ""networks"", turned into ""model factories"", CITY emphasizes an individualized attention, a close cooperation as partners and a personal care to every model. In the long run. Because becoming a fashion icon does require time.
No surprise that with this unique style of model-branding and imaging, CITY enjoys a privileged relation with the most prestigious clients in the fashion world, Chanel, Dior, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Hermés, Armani, Givenchy, St Laurent, L'Oreal, Garnier , Lancome, Guerlain, …as well as the best photographers and magazines, Vogue, Numéro, Harper's Bazar, Elle, l'Officiel, …
Many legends are born in CITY
Leslie Winner, Helena Christensen, Tyra Banks, Christie Brinkley, Susan Hess, Cameron Alborzian (the first male supermodel) , Elle Mc Pherson, Carmen Kass, Laetitia Firmin-Didot, Isabelli Fontana, Suzanne Lanza, Carolyn Murphy, Cecilia Chancellor , Marie-Sophie Wilson, Liliana Dominguez, Laeticia Birkheuer, Emma Balfour, Chandra North, Farida Khelfa, Chrystele Saint Louis Augustin, Hye Park, Joan Smalls, Irina Shayk, Bar Refaelli, Eva Herzigova, … were discovered and turned into stars by CITY.
Many also flourished their talents in theaters, music, cinema, and art such as : Carla Bruni, Devon Aoki, Ines Sastre, Emmanuelle Seigner, Julie Delpy, Anna Mouglalis, Juliette Desurmont, Maiwenn Le Besco, Isild Le Besco, Jane Bradbury, Zoe Felix, Lucie de La Falaise, Elisa Sednaoui, Laurence Treil, Claire Nebout, Claire Forlani, Lou Doillon, Clémence Poésy , Dorothée Gilbert, … just to name a few.
Poésie, Grâce, et Rébellion
Des filles androgynes, des garçons manqués, des tempéraments de feu, des filles à personnalité
Quand Louise Despointes fonde CITY MODELS en 1978 - la plus ancienne des agences de mannequins françaises - suivie ensuite par Frédérika Lévy et Lionel Dejean à la tête de l’agence, elle commence par recruter parmi ses amis et dans la rue. Elle recherche de vraies « gueules » : des filles androgynes, des garçons manqués, des tempéraments de feu, des filles avec des tonnes de personnalité. Des James Dean au féminin, des aliens tatoués, une vraie indienne Crow… des chats écorchés dont City exalte la singularité poétique, attirant des photographes tels que Paolo Roversi ou Peter Lindbergh, des magazines comme Vogue ou Elle.
« Un talent inégalé pour découvrir la beauté où personne ne la voyait,… avant qu’ils ne la voient tous »
Ce sont les gênes de CITY : une approche radicale, une esthétique iconoclaste, choisir celles que les autres qualifieraient d’ « anti-mannequins » et de rebelles et les transformer en personnages inspirants et iconiques.
Subversive par nature, CITY a créé un nouveau standard de beauté et y est demeurée fidèle :
A l’opposé des réseaux d’agences, devenus des usines à mannequins, CITY met l’accent sur une attention individualisée, une collaboration équilibrée entre deux partenaires et un soin apporté à chaque mannequin. Dans le long terme. Parce qu’imposer une icône de mode prend du temps.
C’est alors sans surprise, qu’avec ce savoir-faire unique qui transforme un mannequin en une marque célèbre mondialement, que CITY bénéficie d’une relation privilégiée avec les clients les plus prestigieux du monde de la mode, Chanel, Dior, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Hermés, Armani, Givenchy, St Laurent, L’Oréal, Garnier, Lancôme, Guerlain, … comme les meilleurs photographes et magazines, Vogue, Numéro, Harper’s Bazar, Elle, L’Officiel, …
